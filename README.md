INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Load the required data (specified as comments in KMCode or HierCode; see 'sampleWorkspace.mat' for an example) in the MATLAB workspace before running 'KMCode.m' for KMeans-FWPD or 'HierCode.m' for HAC-FWPD.
2. The resulting cluster assignments can be found in the array 'assignNew_miss'.
3. To only artificially generate missingness, without clustering the data, use the function 'missGenerator.m'.
